# Biography

I have devoted my studies and research to gain a deep knowledge in GIScience. My current studies in the Geography Department and my background obtained in Civil Surveying helped me in developing and implementing concepts and applications that combine modern science with classical engineering concepts in the GIS environment. I am interested in developing spatial data structures and geometric algorithms, the analyzing and mining of complicated spatial data, and linking geospatial mathematical concepts to real-world issues. As a Ph.D. candidate at CU Boulder, I specialized in terrain modelling, geocomputation, and GIS/Python programming. My doctoral research focuses on incorporating terrain slope and curvature into GIS modeling computations, monitoring the reduction in error that occurs across multiple scales. Since 2014, I have been employed continuously as a teaching assistant in the Geography Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. As such, I have led core academic activities focusing on both theoretical concepts in GIS and cartographic visualization, as well as their applications.
