# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This research proposes a new method to determine the best thresholds within previously established channel density partitions of the hydrological unit of interest. To obtain the best threshold, flow direction and flow accumulation are first calculated for the whole study area. Next, the study area is categorized on the basis of stream network density that is calculated from the vector NHD. The selection of an optimal flow accumulation threshold value iterates through a progression of values selected through a binary search. Results are compared to the benchmark data set, until a threshold value achieves the stream channel that is closest to the benchmark data set (Fig. 2). The results illustrate that the proposed method provides a more geographically and hydrologically valid database representation of elevation-derived stream networks."
